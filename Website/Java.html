    <h4>What is Java? </h4>
    <p>
        Java is a versatile, object oriented programming language that runs on most devices. It powers everything from 
        enterprise software and web applications to smartphone operating systems and many widely used programs. Even though it was created over 
        two decades ago, Java remains one of the most popular languages for app developers today. Java's key strength lies in its object oriented 
        design, which organizes code around classes and objects instead of just functions or commands. This approach makes programs easier to manage, 
        reuse, and expand. Another major advantage of Java is its cross platform compatibility. Programs written in Java can run on different types of 
        devices, from smartphones and tablets to smart TVs and IoT devices. Java is used for developing mobile and web apps, enterprise software, cloud based 
        systems, gaming applications, and big data solutions. Its flexibility and reliability have made it a go to language for countless real world applications.
