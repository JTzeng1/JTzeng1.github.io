        <p> Code Compass is a website built to help beginners navigate the often confusing world of computer programming. 
            For many people interested in technology, the biggest challenge isn't knowing how to write code yet, it's 
            figuring out where to start. With so many programming languages out there, each with different uses and career paths, 
            it can feel overwhelming to choose the right one. That's where Code Compass comes in. This site focuses on four of the most versatile and well Known programming languages: 
            Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript. Instead of diving straight into coding lessons, Code Compass gives you a general understanding 
            of what each language is, why it matters, and what you can do with it.</p>

    <div class = "bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li>Python – Known for its simplicity and flexibility, Python is used in areas like data science, artificial intelligence, and 
            web development.</li>
            <li>C++ – A powerful language often used in game development, operating systems, and performance heavy applications.</li>
            <li>Java – Popular for building large applications, mobile apps, and enterprise level software.</li>
            <li>JavaScript – The language of the web, essential for interactive websites, front end development, and beyond.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        
    <div class ="overview">

        <p>By exploring these languages, visitors get a sense of the many directions a career in computer science can take. Whether 
            you dream of building apps, creating websites, analyzing data, or designing video games, Code Compass shows you how these
            tools can turn ideas into reality.</p>

        <p>In addition to explaining what each language can do, the site also highlights what kinds of jobs use them and points you toward resources to begin learning. 
            That way, you not only see the possibilities but also have the first steps laid out in front of you. The mission of Code Compass is simple: to act as a 
            roadmap for aspiring programmers. Instead of feeling lost in a sea of choices, you'll have a clear understanding of the strengths of these four languages 
            and how they connect to different careers. With this knowledge, you can make more confident decisions about what to learn first and where to go next on your
            journey into computer science</p>
