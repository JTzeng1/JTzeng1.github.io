        <h4>What is Python?</h4>

        <p>Python is a popular programming language used for building websites, creating software, automating repetitive 
        tasks, and analyzing data. It's a general-purpose language, which means it can create any type of Program. Python is easy to learn and extremely 
        flexible, it has become one of the most widely used languages in the world. In fact, research from Statista shows that 
        it's the third most commonly used language among developers worldwide</p>


        <h4>What can i do with Python? </h4>
        <br>
        <p><b>1. Data Analysis and Machine Learning</b></p>
        <p> Python is a used in data science for analyzing data, creating visualizations, and building machine learning models that power things like recommendation systems or AI tools.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>2. Web Development</b></p>
        <p>Python often runs the back end of websites and applications the parts users don't directly see. It can handle sending and
        receiving data, connecting with databases, routing URLs, and keeping sites secure. Popular Python web frameworks include Django 
        and Flask. Developers who use Python in this field often work as back end engineers, full stack developers, or software engineers</p>

        <p><b>3. Automation and Scripting</b></p>
        <p>One of Python's biggest strengths is automation. Developers use it to speed up routine tasks like software testing, bug tracking, and build management. 
        Tools like Green and Requestium make it easier to test new software features automatically.</p>
