        <h4>What is Web Stack</h4>
        <p>A web stack is a set of software components that work together to build and run websites or web applications. At a minimum, 
        it includes an operating system (OS), a programming language, database software, and a web server. The term “stack” reflects how these 
        components are layered and interdependent, working together to handle web development tasks efficiently. Choosing the right stack is important, 
        as the wrong combination can slow development or cause problems.</p>


        <h4>The FrontEnd Web Stacks</h4>
        <p>The front end is the part of a website or web application that users see and interact with directly. For example, 
        when you open an online store in your browser, everything you see—the layout, images, buttons, and menus—is part of the front end.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of the most widely used front end programming language include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML: A markup language that defines the structure of web pages and tells browsers how to display content</li>
            <li>CSS: A style language that controls the appearance of HTML elements, including fonts, layouts, colors, and sizes.</li>
            <li>JavaScript: A scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive content on web pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src = "1705513570360.png" alt = python width="210" height="170">

        <p>In web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together like the foundation, walls, and electricity of a house—each serving a critical role. 
        HTML provides the structure, organizing content and defining the layout of the page. CSS adds visual style, controlling colors, fonts, spacing, and overall 
        design to make the page attractive and readable. JavaScript brings the page to life with interactivity, animations, and dynamic content that responds to user 
        actions. Each technology is essential: without HTML there's no structure, without CSS there's no visual appeal, and without JavaScript there's no interactivity.
        Combined, they create a fully functional, engaging, and user friendly web experience. </p>
